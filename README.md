## What is this? (in plain words)

You're building something with Claude Code, but:

- it keeps using words you don't understand (and don't feel like looking up), and
- you're not totally sure it's doing things "the right way".

This skill fixes both. When you turn it on, Claude:

- **talks to you the way *you* choose** — no jargon at all, jargon *with* simple
  explanations, or jargon as usual;
- **follows good engineering habits automatically** — tests, safe commits, a real
  folder structure, no leaked passwords — so your project doesn't turn into a mess.

You don't need to know what "migration", "CORS" or "architecture" mean. That's
the whole point. Beginners and experienced devs both use it — it just adapts.

## Why I built this

I was coding with Claude Code and ran into two things that bugged me:

1. It kept throwing around technical words I didn't understand — and honestly
   didn't want to stop and learn right then.
2. I wanted it to just follow the basics of good software — a real architecture,
   tests, careful commits — instead of improvising something different every time.

So I built this to keep Claude **on the rails**. And while I was at it, I made it
friendly enough that someone with **zero coding background** can use Claude
comfortably too.

## Should you use it on your project?

Honest answer: **not always.** The guard-rails cost something — tests, checks
and commits on every feature — so they have to buy you more than they cost.

| Project | Use it? |
|---|---|
| A real app/site/API you'll keep working on (weeks, months) | ✅ Yes — the sweet spot |
| Your first serious project / learning by building something real | ✅ Yes — it was made for this |
| Anything with a database and/or a public repo | ✅ Yes — the migration and secret rules exist for exactly this |
| A quick throwaway script or one-afternoon experiment | ❌ No — plain Claude is faster; the overhead isn't worth it |
| An existing codebase with its own conventions / a team project | ❌ Not yet — the skill assumes a fresh project |

Rule of thumb: **if the project will still matter in two weeks, turn it on; if
it's disposable, don't.** That's also why it only runs when you invoke it
explicitly.

## How to use

### 1. Install (once)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JulioBarbosaS/Claude-For-Idiots.git
cp -r Claude-For-Idiots ~/.claude/skills/claude-for-idiots
```

Then restart Claude Code so it picks up the new skill. (The hooks need `python3`
available on your machine.)

### 2. Turn it on — explicitly

In a Claude Code session, run:

```
/claude-for-idiots
```

**It only runs when you ask for it — on purpose.** Not every project should be
wrapped in these guard-rails: a quick throwaway script, or an existing codebase
that already has its own conventions, are usually better left alone. So this
skill **never takes over by itself** — you switch it on, per project, when you
actually want it.

Once it's on, it asks a few quick questions — your language, your experience
level, whether to use technical terms, and what you want to build — and sets
everything up for that project.

> **Heads-up:**
> - The guided setup takes **~10 minutes** (measured on Opus 4.8) — it asks the
>   questions, picks the stack, installs the tooling and writes the guard-rails.
> - **Beginners:** run Claude Code in **auto mode** (auto-accept permissions)
>   during setup, so you're not interrupted by a permission prompt at every step.
> - **Not yet tested for deployment** — the skill covers local development;
>   deploy workflows are on the roadmap.

## What it improves

After setup, Claude follows these in **every** session of that project. The ones
marked **(enforced)** are guaranteed by hooks — Claude literally can't break them:

- **No hand-editing database migrations** *(enforced)* — uses the proper
  generator command instead.
- **New files stay inside the chosen architecture** *(enforced)* — nothing dumped
  at random.
- **Secrets never reach the internet** *(enforced)* — keys/passwords stay in a
  local `.env`; anything that publishes is scanned first.
- **Always writes tests** — and asks before running the slow full suite.
- **Commits after each feature** — so you never lose progress.
- **Sanity check after each feature** — lint, the feature's tests, and actually
  booting the app to see it work.
- **Sets up code-quality tools for your stack** (formatter + linter) — the code
  stays clean automatically.
- **Reuses before rebuilding** — checks the codebase (and `docs/`) for something
  that already does the job before writing it again.
- **Keeps a `docs/` folder for big decisions and hard-won lessons** — knowledge
  survives without bloating every session.
- **Knows when to stop guessing** — after two failed fixes it stops, re-reads
  the error, checks versions and researches the web before trying again.
- **For web apps, it can check the browser itself** — loads the page, reads the
  console for hidden errors, takes screenshots (with Playwright set up — it
  offers to configure it).

And it adapts to **you**:

- **Experience level** — beginner / intermediate / advanced: decides how much it
  explains and whether it picks the tech stack for you.
- **Technical terms** — `none` (plain language only) · `explain` (uses the term
  plus a simple explanation that gets deeper as you learn) · `raw` (terms as usual).

**How it sticks:** the setup writes a `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded every session) plus
the hooks, so the rules keep working even in long sessions — not just while the
skill is open.
